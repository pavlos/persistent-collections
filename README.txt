Implementations of Java collections interfaces that use the file system for storage (instead of memory).

Useful for:
* performing operations on collections too large to fit in memory
* persisting any Serializable object

Please note: This project is still in the proof of concept stage, and by no means ready to use in a
live application.  However, if you'd like to collaborate with me, please send me a message on Github.
